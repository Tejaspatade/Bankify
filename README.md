# Bankify

Banking, Simplified. A modern looking startup for banking purposes. This is a demo website for this imaginary startup. Built it to showcase my Vanilla JS skills. It has an elegant and beautiful landing page with dynamic features. The main banking system is also implemented that uses objects and arrays like JSON format to store users data an perform some simlpe banking transactions. These are just sample cases and don't implement any actual security measures like a bank does.
